# Over The Menai, Down Anglesey Way
Project in Logic PRO for a song written by 
T. Michaeliones and Bill Hammond


Using Score editor in Logic PRO

Issues
* key: in F, yet in Logic, cant see how to enable lower notes for the second treble score
* some notes are not possible AFAIK in Logic, leading to some flatness
* tempo?!?
